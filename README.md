Hello World! My name is Monica, and I am here to present a new Youtube channel called “Somos Mariposas” translated into english “We are Butterflies”. The monarch butterfly is my inspiration because it is a migratory butterfly from United States to Mexico in the summer time. My father's job brought my family to United States from Mexico when I was a toddler, and I feel very privileged, when I have seen other fellow latinos not be so lucky. People are migrating to United States for a better life, currently in 2018 most are here seeking asylum. I feel in doing my part, I have to help somehow. I have always believed knowledge is power, and education is the solution to many things such as poverty. When I see latinos risk their lives for a better future to only wind up having low paying jobs and zero representation in new advancements, I feel life is unfair. I also feel life is unfair especially for the latina woman, who out of both genders, the male has been favored.

Now more than ever, latina women need access to resources that will help them succeed in their future. That is why I want to create content through Youtube and Github that is free to access for anyone; but I am especially concerned in helping latin women. I know right now, I can only reach middle class women, because it is those who have access to computers and internet, that will be able to access this content. I hope one day this can also reach other levels of income. 

I am a latina woman working in the tech industry in the United States, and I have seen the lack of representation, in the tech sector.
According to Catalyst.org, in United States women that hold a STEM bachelor degree who identify as latinas, are 3.6%. IMF reported that in Latin America 54% of women are in the workforce, which increased from 40% from early 1990s, which roughly translates to .4% increase per year for, which is less than 1% increase per year for the last 30 years.
Times are changing but it needs to be at a more rapid place at parity to other countries and the way technology is advancing to not get left behind and to make sure we have equal representation in decision making in the technology sector.
I read a stat from the website previously mentioned (Catalyst) that women in Mexico who opted for a post secondary education (17% of women),  of that 17%, ⅓ of them were STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) degrees. 

Although I am for women picking any sector they want to work in, I believe the technology sector is where women are needed the most. We are at the precipice of our century where computers, not humans are making decisions and where processes are being automated as technology advances.
That is also the sector where people working in that industry, being employed is the most stable and pays above average at least in United States, with the average being $135K,000.

I have not seen a lot of content being translated into Spanish so I am here to contribute my part.
