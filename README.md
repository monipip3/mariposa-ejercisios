Hello World! My name is Monica, and I am here to present a new Youtube channel called “Somos Mariposas” translated into english “We are Butterflies”.
I am a latina woman working in the tech industry in the United States, and I have seen the lack of representation, in the tech sector.
According to Catalyst.org, in United States women that hold a STEM bachelor degree who identify as latinas, are 3.6%. IMF reported that in Latin America 54% of women are in the workforce, which increased from 40% from early 1990s, which roughly translates to .4% increase per year for, which is less than 1% increase per year for the last 30 years.
Times are changing but it needs to be at a more rapid place at parity to other countries and the way technology is advancing to not get left behind and to make sure we have equal representation in decision making in the technology sector.
I read a stat from the website previously mentioned (Catalyst) that women in Mexico who opted for a post secondary education (17% of women),  of that 17%, ⅓ of them were STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) degrees. 

Although I am for women picking any sector they want to work in, I believe the technology sector is where women are needed the most. We are at the precipice of our century where computers, not humans are making decisions and where processes are being automated as technology advances.
That is also the sector where people working in that industry, being employed is the most stable and pays above average at least in United States, with the average being $135K,000.
